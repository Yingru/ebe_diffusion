                      ! 1 - re-sample pT distribution according to wt table
                      ! 2 - use uniform distribution (may re-weight them later for analysis)

eta_cut...    0.5     ! rapidity cut, symmetric inteval
pT_min....    0.25    ! minimum value of initial pT
pT_max....    70.25   ! maximum value of initial pT

wt_num....    140     ! Number of points in the table
                      ! Maximum number is 300 by default. If exceeded, change wt_MAXnum in df_coms.f
wt_int....    0.5     ! Bin size of the weight table
wt_Tab_min    0.5     ! Minium pT value inside the table
#
# Running modes
out_skip..    1       ! Control how many time steps for each output
                      ! 0 - no evolution, output init. condition
                      ! 1 - only output the last time step
                      ! Other positive integers
exp_setup.    1       ! 1 - LHC 2.76~TeV; 2 - RHIC 200~GeV (doesn't work for HQ_input=1)
ebe_flag..    2       ! Event-by-event study: (must choose 2 when HQ_input is not 2)
                      ! 0 - smooth initial condition; 
                      ! 1 - e-by-e study
                      ! 2 - no rotation
corr_flag.    0       ! 1 for calculation of HF pair correlation
#
# Other options for the code
static....    2       ! Choose the type of medium
                      ! 0 - Chiho's hydro, 1 - Static, 2 - CCNU hydro
stat_cool.    0       ! If static=1, stat_cool=1 provides cooling of Bjorken's expansion

tsteps_cut    140     ! Control total timesteps for Langevin evolution 
                      ! (One timestep for 0.1~fm/c)
                      ! Necessary for static=1 and helpful for static=2
temp_cut..    1       ! 0 for no cut, 1 for cut (necessary for dynamic medium)
